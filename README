# Project Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Install Kali Linux (Headless) using WSL:

    ```bash
    wsl --install kali-linux-headless
    ```

2. Update the package lists:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3. Perform a full system upgrade:

    ```bash
    sudo apt full-upgrade -y
    ```

4. Install Kali Linux (Headless):

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y kali-linux-headless
    ```

5. Run the `run.sh` script:

    ```bash
    sudo bash run.sh
    ```

6. Download and install RustScan (version 2.0.1):

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/releases/download/2.0.1/rustscan_2.0.1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i rustscan_2.0.1_amd64.deb
    rm rustscan_2.0.1_amd64.deb
    ```

7. Set executable permissions for the `gau` script:

    ```bash
    chmod +x utilities/tools/scripts/gau
    ```

That's it! The project setup is complete. You can now proceed with your development or testing tasks.

TO DO: 
- Configure the wordlist folder for tools such as `wfuzz`, `dnsrecon`, and `dirsearch`.
- Fix the issue with `dirsearch` not found.
- Remove color from `wpscan` output.
- Make sure the `sqlmap` command is enclosed in quotes for the target.
- Ensure the target URLs are specified correctly, as some tools may prefer URLs without the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) or `www.` prefix. Additional testing may be required, especially for `wpscan`.
- Automate user interaction for `sqlmap` by answering "yes" to any prompts.
